# Portfolio-2

Hello world!
This is my professional portfolio displaying all of my projoects and applications that I have developed using front-end

With this assignment I want to sharpen up my skills using CSS and the layout of the page

I am also going to take screen shots of my projects and use them as the thumbnails for my portfolio page

Hopefully this will be the portfolio I will continue to use and add other assignments to as I progress as a developer 8/20
